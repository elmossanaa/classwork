/**Miles-per-Gallon Calculator
Write a GUI application that calculates a carâ€™s gas mileage. The application should let the user enter the number of gallons of gas the car holds, and the number of miles it can be driven on a full tank. When a Calculate MPG button is clicked, the application should display the number of miles that the car may be driven per gallon of gas. Use the following formula to calculate miles per gallon: MPG = miles / gallons **/
